This is the necessary background context and information about what we are trying to build and what it accomplishes and will be used for. 

We are creating kCERT (KPMG Comprehensive Excel Review Tool). This tool will be used for us and our clients.

This tool will be an Excel plug in. The purpose of it is to review an Excel based model.

- all of our clients use a lot of Excel
- sometimes it is simple, sometimes it is not (spreads the whole gammit of Excel usage) and how complicated it may be
- some are very important, enter into a risk management and governance pipeline (sometimes are models, sometimes are not)
- very important and need documentation, and need to be reviewed for accuracy (accuracy = are formulas correct, bad references, etc.) not exactly how good the prediction is

- problem: excel files are very complex /and or have a ton of nuance and shit going on in them
- one of the benefit of Excel is the accessibility in Excel (everyone can use it)
- downfall of Excel: quite unique in the fact that the functionality is that the ouput masks its functionality (i.e., if you saw an excel sheet you would see the output but do not know what each excel cell refers to (formula, reference, etc.)

- prlbme: makes a simple excel file, it then creates an excel file with a ton of formulas
- tell someone at the bank that the excel file needs governance (check formulas)
- everyeone will review differently, not standardized, human nature will make them lazy and not check everything

- on paper excel files have been reviewed, or have not been reviewed thoroughly -> little tiny errors persist period over period 
LACK OF TRANSPARECY of formuals causes errors to persist

- often have a hard time keeping track or evidence that the review was done (LAKC OF AUDIT TRAIL)
- reliances on the UK membership tool, they neeed to support it and we are reliant on it
- internal risk management needs to be aware, cannot be in the market of it

-> SO:

- makes it easier and faster to do the review
- creates the output and audit trail for the evidence that was created
- want to start exploring making this tool and replicating it
